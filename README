BBii 1.0.9
==========

Copyright (c) 2013-2015, BBii - Ronald van Belzen. All rights reserved.  
 - See accompanying LICENSE for license information.

BBii is an extension to the Yii Framework (http://www.yiiframework.com/license/) 
in the form of a module. BBii adds and integrates a lightweight webforum (a.k.a. 
bulletin board) to an existing Yii 1.1 application.


##Requirements

Yii 1.1.8 or above.
PHP 5.3 or above.
The application to which BBii is added needs to have a user table.


##Usage

* Extract the zip file to the application's protected/modules directory
* Create database tables according to bbii/data/schema.mysql.sql
* Import sample data from bbii/data/sampledata.mysql.sql
* Create the subdirectory 'avatar’ in your application webroot directory to which 
  the application must be given read/write access rights.
* Edit your configuration to register the module (the default option values may 
  need to be adjusted):
~~~
[php]
'modules' => array(
	'forum' => array(
		'class' => 'application.modules.bbii.BbiiModule',
		'adminId' => 1,
		'userClass' => 'User',
		'userIdColumn' => 'id',
		'userNameColumn' => 'username',
	),
),
~~~

* BBii requires a user database table to be present that at least contains an 
  integer User ID field and a varchar User name field. BBii also expects 
  Yii::$app->user->id to return the User ID, not the User name. The model for 
  the user table and the column names for the User ID column and the User name 
  column are part of the module options.
* Log in to your application with the user that has the User ID equal to the 
  value for the option 'adminId’ to acquire administration rights in BBii.
* Navigate to http://<your base url>/forum. Click the link 'Forum settings’ and 
  set up the forum.

NOTE: BBii uses the layout '//layouts/column1' that comes with the default Yii 
application. When you need to use a different layout this needs to be changed 
in the script components/BbiiController.php.

##Options

The following configuration options can be used:
adminId:        	the User ID (integer) for the user to receive the admin 
					authorization (default value: false). When the application
					uses rbac and the role 'admin’ exists the users that get 
					the role 'admin’ assigned will also be admin for BBii.
avatarStorage:  	The directory in which uploaded avatar images are stored 
					relative to the application webroot directory (leading '/’
